2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to clock(s) sys_clock_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on usb_uart_rxd relative to clock(s) sys_clock_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on usb_uart_txd relative to clock(s) sys_clock_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/StreamCopIPCore_0/U0/StreamCopIPCore_v1_0_S00_AXIS_inst/nextState_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/StreamCopIPCore_0/U0/StreamCopIPCore_v1_0_S00_AXIS_inst/nextState_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/StreamCopIPCore_0/U0/StreamCopIPCore_v1_0_S00_AXIS_inst/nextState_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/StreamCopIPCore_0/U0/StreamCopIPCore_v1_0_S00_AXIS_inst/nextState_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/StreamCopIPCore_0/U0/StreamCopIPCore_v1_0_S00_AXIS_inst/nextState_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/StreamCopIPCore_0/U0/StreamCopIPCore_v1_0_S00_AXIS_inst/nextState_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/StreamCopIPCore_0/U0/StreamCopIPCore_v1_0_S00_AXIS_inst/startFor2_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/StreamCopIPCore_0/U0/StreamCopIPCore_v1_0_S00_AXIS_inst/startFor2_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
